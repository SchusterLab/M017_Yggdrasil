# M017_Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is our newest generation single electron quantum bit experiment. :+1:

The `simulations` folder contains several files that help us with the simulation of our sample. Please note: 
- `.aedt` files are created using Ansys Electronics Desktop 2015.
- `.mxwl` files are created by Ansys Maxwell 2015.

Please do not convert these files to later versions of Ansys software and then commit. These files are usually not backwards compatible.
